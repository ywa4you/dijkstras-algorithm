# dijkstras-algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm python implementation. Mainly created as a part of a challenge posed by my friend.

Numpy is not needed per se, it's only needed if you want to use sp0.py(the older,
slower and not fully functional, e.g. if there is a point referenced by no other point).
It's mainly for my own testing purposes. I'd not recomment it for anyone actually;
I'm going to remove sp0.py from this project soon.
