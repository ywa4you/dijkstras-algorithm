# dijkstras-algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm python implementation. Mainly created as a part of a challenge posed by my friend.

Numpy is not needed per se, it's only needed if you want to use sp0.py(the older,
slower and not fully functional version).
It's mainly for my own testing purposes.
I'm going to remove sp0.py from this project soon.
